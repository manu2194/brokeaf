# BrokeAF

## Overview

BrokeAF is a online expense manager with the intention of employing a purely text-based input. If the user wants to enter an expense, they only have to type an expression such as _20 for haircut_. This is an ongoing project and as such a lot of features are as of now unavailble or incomplete, such as user creation and registration.

## How to use

1. Install all the dependancies with `npm install`
2. Run front-end and back-end together with `npm run dev` or just `npm run server` for back-end and `npm run client` for front-end.
