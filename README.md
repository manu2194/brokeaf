# BrokeAF

## Overview

[BrokeAF](https://bafem.herokuapp.com/) is a online expense manager with the intention of employing a purely text-based input. If the user wants to enter an expense, they only have to type an expression such as _20 for haircut_. This is an ongoing project and as such a lot of features are as of now unavailble or incomplete, changing passwords and expense analyctics.

You can visit the website at [bafem.herokuapp.com](https://bafem.herokuapp.com/).

## How to use

1. Install all the dependancies with `npm install` and `npm run client-install`.
2. Run front-end and back-end together with `npm run dev` or just `npm run server` for back-end and `npm run client` for front-end.

### Notes

This project uses Brad Traversy's [react_express_starter](https://github.com/bradtraversy/react_express_starter) boilerplate as a starting point. I highly recommend using this if you plan on building web apps that use React as the frontend and Node as the backend.
