# BrokeAF

## Overview

BrokeAF is a online expense manager with the intention of employing a purely text-based input. If the user wants to enter an expense, they only have to type an expression such as _20 for haircut_. This is an ongoing project and as such a lot of features are as of now unavailble or incomplete, such as user creation and registration.

## How to use

Simply run _nodemon_ from the root folder and visit [LocalHost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

## Implementation

The backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js written in JavaScript. The Front-end is developed in React.js.
